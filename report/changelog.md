## 1.0.50 · `ac40ff4` — changes on import

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (5:18 PM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/ac40ff49ae24908f440a2013a12daa0a782b61d6)

- Share a chord-page **URL** to Stage Manager to open **Find chart** and extract the page (same as picking a search result); saves to the **archive**, or also adds to the **open playlist** if you shared while viewing one. PDF/image shares still use the normal import dialog.
- Find chart works without a playlist context — archive-only flow with **Add to archive** confirm.
- Settings: OpenAI key validation keeps the green check only (removed redundant “key accepted” text).

---

## 1.0.49 · `ab54932` — minor transpose fixes

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (11:43 AM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/ab549326a458bd473c8ec894bb02e85700081e69)

- Chart preview key label falls back to the first `<chord>` in the chart when the draft has no explicit key.
- Transposer only rewrites bracketed `<chord>` tokens (drops legacy bare-chord matching inside lyrics).
- Transpose ± uses the first chord as the source key when `key` and `sourceKey` are missing.

---

## 1.0.48 · `cabe04b` — don't show null key

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (11:14 AM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/cabe04b09e81270399669c4f8cbcf06dcfb7973d)

- JSON null or missing key fields no longer render as the literal string “null” in PDF headers or the key preview.
- Optional AI fields (artist, capo, notes, source URL) normalized the same way.

---

## 1.0.47 · `39818e1` — improve AI/storage count

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (10:49 AM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/39818e1e6097902afed451eff194cf21f0c80372)

- Settings **Storage** row shows total library size under `Music/StageManager` (song files, chart sidecars, database, and state).
- AI chart generation uses bracketed `<chord>` tokens; PDF renders chords in bold monospace separate from lyric lines.
- In-app update download/install banner appears on Settings (hidden on other screens while Settings is open).

---

## 1.0.46 · `0c69200` — retranspose/mic UI

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (8:51 AM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/0c6920090cdf70dc0fede70687460f55504953e4)

- **New key** on AI charts: edit dialog (Songs list or song view) opens transpose/PDF preview to pick a key and save; source chords/lyrics stored as `.chart.json` beside the PDF.
- Find chart no longer asks for a key by voice — search is title/artist only; transpose with +/− in preview before saving.
- Transposer uses conventional flat/sharp spelling (e.g. Bb in F, not A#).
- Settings: PIN + OpenAI key + **Save**, then app version and **Check for updates** (49152–65535 PIN range).
- Mic UX: “Listening… release to send”.

---

## 1.0.45 · `28a1bd7` — open AI integration

**Released:** 2026-06-25 (8:06 AM EDT) · [commit](https://github.com/diegoboston/playlists/commit/28a1bd7508e168a8d528b4c7e7394d18193c6f42)

- **Find chart** on playlist detail: hold the mic, voice-parse the request, search the web, preview a one-page chord PDF, transpose, and add to the playlist.
- Settings stores your **OpenAI API key** on-device (encrypted) with live validation before save.
- OpenAI pipeline: Whisper transcription, intent JSON, chart draft generation, plus chord transposition and PDF rendering.
